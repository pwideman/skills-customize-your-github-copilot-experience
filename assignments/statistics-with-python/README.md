# 📘 Assignment: Statistics with Python

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to perform data analysis and statistical calculations using Python's powerful pandas and numpy libraries to analyze real-world datasets and draw meaningful insights.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Data Loading and Exploration

#### Description
Load a dataset using pandas and perform initial data exploration to understand the structure, quality, and characteristics of your data. You'll learn to identify patterns, missing values, and basic statistical properties.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Load a CSV dataset using pandas
- Display basic information about the dataset (shape, columns, data types)
- Show the first and last few rows of the data
- Identify and report any missing values
- Generate summary statistics for numerical columns
- Create basic data visualizations (histograms, box plots)

### 🛠️	Statistical Analysis and Calculations

#### Description
Perform comprehensive statistical analysis on your dataset using numpy and pandas functions. Calculate measures of central tendency, dispersion, and correlation to understand relationships in your data.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Calculate mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical columns
- Find minimum, maximum, and quartile values
- Compute correlation coefficients between numerical variables
- Perform groupby operations to analyze data by categories
- Create comparison charts between different groups or time periods
- Generate at least 3 meaningful insights from your statistical analysis
- Export your results to a new CSV file with summary statistics
